roti prata ,"A dough-based flat pancake that is cooked by heating over a flat grill plate. The origins of this Indian dish is a story in itself. It has its roots in southern India*, possibly the city of Chennai (formerly Madras), where it is called parata (variations include parotha or paratha). In Malaysia, this dish is in fact named Roti Chennai (also spelled ""roti chanai"" or ""roti canai""), after the city. Roti prata is commonly served with curry (either vegetable or meat curries), but it is not unusual to see it being eaten plain with white large-grain sugar. Prata-making has been refined to such an art that if you're lucky, you'll sometimes see cooks get theatrical with the flipping and turning of the prata as it's being cooked over the plate. 

* Another source (Anasuya Balamurugan) attributes this dish to Punjabi or vaguely ""Muslim conqueror"" origins. Wherefrom the ""Muslim conquerors"" hailed wasn't made clear, and my guess is it could have been in reference to the Arabs or Turks. Another close cousin to the prata is the naan(also spelt ""nan"" or ""na'an""), which is common in northern/north-western India(Punjab, Rajasthan) and Pakistan. Although made differently (by baking in a tandoor, which is an oven made of clay), it is similar in terms of texture and ingredients."
